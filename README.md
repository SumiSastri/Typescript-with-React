#### Project goals

This project is one in a series of tutorials following documentation. In this project, I explore the documentation of TypeScript with JavaScript, React & React-Redux.

#### Folder structure

There are 3 folders in this project - each section adds a level of complexity to the learning process. Each folder has its own readme to document what I have learnt. It simplifies the documentation I have read, research from blogs and following some tutorials for specific areas that I found difficult to understand. It serves as a place I can go to for quick reference to code snippets.

1. [TypeScript Fundamentals - with vanilla JS](https://github.com/SumiSastri/Typescript-with-React/tree/master/node-ts)

Pure tutorial with code snippet examples

2. [TypeScript and React-Hooks](https://github.com/SumiSastri/Typescript-with-React/tree/master/to-do-list-ts)

A to-do-list application

3. [TypeScript and React-Redux](https://github.com/SumiSastri/Typescript-with-React/tree/master/react-redux-ts)

An API call to the Rick & Morty show, using the Reach Router and creating a favorites episode page.
