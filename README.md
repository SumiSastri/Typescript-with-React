# Brief History of JavaScript
- Brenden Eich creates LiveScript for Netscape 1995
- Microsoft adopts it as JS-Script later renamed to JavaScript
- Browser wars begin - each browser developer wants their version of JavaScript
- Fragmentation of JavaScript as a result - VS8 (Chrome) Chakra(Microsoft) SpiderMonkey(Safari)
- ECMA takes over standardisation of JavaScript 
- ES6 (2015-2016) some major changes - introduces classes and the lamda arrow function
- 2016-2020 continuous updates small incremental changes each year

# Typescript overview
Typescript, is an open-source library created by Anders Hejlsberg for Microsoft. It is a superset of JavaScript that allows static typing. It is what C++ is to C. Browsers do not compile Typescript, so it requires a transpiler (compiler) to convert back into JavaScript. Based on the dotnet system and is closely related to object oriented programming languages.

Problems that TypeScript solves - as it is statically typed it reduces errors (bugs) as types are checked automatically preventing the accidental assignment of invalid values. It is easier to maintain in the long-term as it handles.

- Corrects type coercian of disparite types in compile time
- JavaScript's dynamic typing changed to static typing, check errors in run time
- Bugs caught early in compile type not when it is too late (in runtime) 
- Scope clarity of variables in functions/ methods
- Support for more types - enums, tuples
- Better structure of code base
- Transpiles ECMA-6 onwards back to js for cross-browser rendering
- Cross platform - client and server side/ across different libraries

eg. ```@types/react``` for react or the Microsoft search [https://microsoft.github.io/TypeSearch/]

It is useful to go through the documentation first and then the tutorials

TypeScript Playground is to Typescript what JFiddle is to JavaScript [https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/]
